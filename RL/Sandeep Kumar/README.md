 This project "Learning RL to develop AI agents" is offered by ACA(Association of Computer Activities IITK).
 ## General Concepts :
 ### <u> Introduction to Machine Learning </u>
 Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.<br>
 A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,if its performance on T,as measured by P, improves with experience E.
 #### <ins>Machine learning algorithms:</ins>
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- ***Reinforcement learning.*** 

#### <ins>Model Representation</ins>
Generaling speaking,The aim of the supervised learning algorithm is to use the given training Dataset and output a ***Hypothesis function***.Where Hypothesis function takes the input instance and predicts the output based on its learnings from the training dataset.

##### <ins>Linear	regression	with	one	variable.</ins>

For linear regression in one variable,the hypothesis function will be of the form-<br>
h(x) = ***Θ***0 + ***Θ***1*x         <br>where, ***Θ***0 and ***Θ***1 are the parameters.

The line seen in the graph is the Hypothesis function. This line is the best fit that passes through most of the points.<br>
Now we know it's not possible to tell the hypothesis function by merely looking at the graph! We need some systematic way to figure it out.<br>

<ins>***Cost Function***</ins> helps us to figure out which hypothesis best fits our data. Or more formally,It helps us to measure the <ins>error</ins> of our hypothesis.It's often called the squared error function.<br><br>
Mathematically, Cost function —<br>

<pre>
(h(x) — y)² : Squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the hypothesis.
∑(h(x) — y)²/2m: Average Squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the hypothesis, i.e Mean Squared error.
</pre>

Now we have our hypothesis function and we also have a method of measuring how well it fits into the given data.All we need to do is find the value of parameters(***Θ***0 and ***Θ***1) for which the cost function (i.e. error) is minimum.<br> That’s where gradient descent comes into the picture

<ins>***Gradient descent***</ins> is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function.Gradient descent is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters that minimize a cost function as much as possible.[Here](https://builtin.com/data-science/gradient-descent) you can find more details about Gradient descent.<br>

Mathematical form of Gradient Descent for Linear Regression-<br>
<pre>
repeat until Convergence:{
                   Theta(0) := Theta(0) - (α/m)* Σ(h(xi) - yi)
                   Theta(1) := Theta(1) - (α/m)* Σ(h(xi) - yi)
}
Note:- 1) Update Theta(0) and Theta(1) Simultaneously.
       2) Σ is done for i=0 to m.  where, m is Number of training examples in training dataset.
Here, α is the size of each step known as the Learning rate. The value of α should be selected with care to ensure that the gradient descent algorithm converges correctly in a reasonable time.
